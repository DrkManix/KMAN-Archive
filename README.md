# Artefact
A briefcase is a narrow hard-sided box-shaped bag or case used mainly for carrying papers and equipped with a handle. Lawyers commonly use briefcases to carry briefs to present to a court, hence the name. Businesspeople and other white collar professionals also use briefcases to carry papers, and since the 1980s, electronic devices such as laptop computers and tablet computers. Some briefcases have only a main internal space, while others may have subsections, accordion sections, small pockets, or dividers. 
This is a briefcase from The **Democratic Confederation of Labour** (CDT). It is a [national trade union center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_trade_union_center) in [Morocco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco). It was established in 1978.
Traditionally, the CDT was allied with the [Socialist Union of Popular Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Union_of_Popular_Forces) (USFP), but in 2002 the union broke its ties and subsequently, secretary general [Noubir El Amaoui](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Noubir_El_Amaoui&action=edit&redlink=1) created his own political party.

# Research
## KMAN Origins
[<"https://github.com/DrkManix/KMAN-Archive/blob/master/img_archive/KMAN-publication_001.jpg" width="50%">]

The Committee for Moroccan Workers in the Netherlands was established on 13 September 1975 at an action meeting of Moroccans in a squatted warehouse on Bloemgracht in the Jordaan, a warehouse in which many action groups, including the Palestinian Committee, Amnesty International and BAK-: Jordaan, had elected their domicile at the time.
Prior to the meeting, a demonstration had been organized by a joint venture of the Moroccan Illegal Committee, the Dutch-Turkish Workers' Association Amsterdam (HTIB), the Surinamese LOSON and the Foreign Workers Collective. The demonstration focused "against the Regularization Measure and against the discriminatory action of the Aliens Police in Amsterdam."
Around 600 workers visited the Aliens Police, the Social Services, the Employment Office and the City Hall where a petition was offered to Mayor Samkalden. At an action meeting of Moroccans in the evening after the demonstration, it was decided in the presence of around 150 people to set up the Committee of Moroccan Workers in the Netherlands (KMAN). A board was chosen and a program was formulated. According to the statements of this meeting, the KMAN had to become an "autonomous and democratic mass organization" with the objective of defending the interests of Moroccan workers in the Netherlands.
The KMAN was a national organization, but also had local departments and divisions, such as the KMAR in Rotterdam and the AMMU in Utrecht.

### The Newspaper
[<"https://github.com/DrkManix/KMAN-Archive/blob/master/img_archive/KMAN-Newspaper1_002.jpg" width="50%">]

Quite soon after the establishment of the KMAN, the first KMAN newspaper appeared, called The Moroccan Worker. The intention was to provide a two-monthly publication. It turned out to be difficult to realize this over and over again. The KMAN newspaper did not appear in 1982. Since the beginning of 1983, an edition of the newspaper appeared again irregularly.
The print run was always quite large, 5,000 to 7,000 copies. One half of the newspaper was in Dutch, the other in Arabic. The content of both parts was not the same, sometimes they were separate articles, sometimes translations or adapted versions. Costs of the newspaper were covered from the sale and from subsidies from the NOVIB. Distribution took place in-house through sales at activities, in the building, through friendly organizations, kiosks and the like. Theme numbers were sent to special organizations and were sometimes taken by them in large numbers. For example, 1500 copies of a themed issue on education were purchased by the ABOP. Up to and including 1988 29 editions of the "Moroccan Worker" were published. In 1990 the KMAN again published a more modest edition: the KMAN bulletin. Local departments often made their own newsletters. In 1995 the first two issues of a new edition of the KMAN entitled MigrantBurger were published <sup>[[1]](#footnote-1)</sup>

### The Amicales Menace
[<"https://github.com/DrkManix/KMAN-Archive/blob/master/img_archive/KMAN-publication_003.jpg" width="50%">]

The Amicales were known for taking active and often violent action against "harmful influences". The Amicales were also active in reporting Moroccans in the Netherlands who were involved in demonstrations, the KMAN, or other elements that were seen as undesirable. On 23 April 1983, for example, the consul received a letter from the Amicales. The Amicales had opened a new office a few days earlier. Neighborhood organizations and the KMAN were present at this opening to demonstrate. The Amicales then found out eight names of Moroccan protesters and mentioned them in the letter.
People who went against the hairs of the Amicales and the Moroccan government were subsequently made life miserable. A good example of this is Abdou Menebhi, who has had to wait for years for his passport application to be fulfilled. The application was made in 1979. In 1982 even the consul in the Netherlands asked to grant the application. Only in 1994 did he actually get the passport.
Physical repression was also not shunned. For example, fighters appeared during the Ajax-Morocco football match in 1976. In January 1982, KMAN members were also physically attacked twice. Once in a cafe in Eindhoven, again on a cultural evening in Geleen.
There was also a raid in 1981 during a hunger strike in the Moses and Aaron Church in Amsterdam.
Finally, the return to Morocco for KMAN members and people who worked with the KMAN was also very difficult. In 1978 one of the 182 hunger strikers was arrested and detained for several weeks.
Later in 1984, Amine el Mouaden, KMAN and ABOP member, was arrested, detained and tortured for several weeks. These names were most likely passed on by the Amicales.

# Transcoding
Using sound and 3D modelling to create a digital fac-similé, (maybe in Unity) that can be opened and display transcoded content from the archive edited into a narrative that follows the question: How does a social movement dies?
The resilience of this archive relies on the diversity of transcription, from image to sound, from picture to written description or drawing, etc.
By creating a narrative, linking the different elements of this archive represented by the briefcase, the goal is to explain the context and the signification of it and its value, either as a document carrier or a reproduction fac-similé, and tp keep its primary function.

You can structure the information and documentation for each transcoding, design research or coding tool as you like. It's important that you make clear the aims & goals of the transcoding, what methods and tools you use. If this is often the same across different transcodings, consider making a standardised table at the beginning of each.

You should include well-formatted documentation of your experiments and developments below. Someone without previous knowledge about your work should be able to follow along the steps, aims and results of your developments from this structure. Make sure all media used is correctly linked or embedded (images, PDFs, Videos, etc). 

### Methods
For this, i assembled different mediums and recorded them many times on differents settings, such as they can be assembled to give the feeling of a spaciality and not just a sound effect.

### Results
Some of your transcoding experiments may have smaller outcome sketches like images or short video tests. They can go directly within this section. Or maybe this transcoding became a part of the final outcome format. When that is the case, you can simply include a [hyperlink](#) to the final outcomes in the **Transcoding** section. In the final outcome section below you can embed or explain the final format outcome in detail.  

## Transcoding Tool 
### Description
You might have made multiple coding tools during the semester. Or the transcoding tool might be part of a specific transcoding experiment itself. It's up to you to define the linear flow of the Readme. Just like the transcoding of media itself, the coding tool should be well documented. So if you are using a coding tool in your first experiment, include the documentation of the coding tool **before** you include the results, etc. 

### Aims
Include the main aims or intentions behind making the tool, and what it is used for. 

### Methods
This includes the coding languages, coding frameworks or libraries, and any platforms or webtools for example.   

### Results
The coding tool will vary a lot between different students. So depending on the use and type, you may include more or less documentation here. 

### Source Links
Please include links to the tools, sources etc used during the coding. E.g. the resources used for making your coding tool.  
 

# Reflection
How do a social movement gets killed/silenced/assimilated by institutions ?
Exemple of the KMAN 

# Outcomes
This section will be different for each student, depending on how and what is formatted as a final result for the semester assignment. Nevertheless a clear written and documented outcomes is important. So give the appropriate subsections or formats to make this as thorough as possible. 

### Outcome Links
Here you link to your final assignment outcomes. This could be a website, a video, etc etc. Please include links to the appropriate GitHub folder on your repository where your coding tool is stored. 

This is the main way to access your IMD + Coding outcomes for the semester. So its very important that you check for bugs, troubleshoot hyperlink issues, embedded media issues etc. Please make sure you KNOW where each file you use is stored. E.g. If you migrated from Notion markdown into GitHub, its **VERY IMPORTANT** to know that Notion randomly stores images on an Amazon server. It changes those locations all the time. So if your main outcome or documentation is still grabbing those links, **its very likely** they might disappear before collectives. So please have all media and necessary files managed well in your own locations (online or github etc).   

# Conclusion 
You might have a nice conclusive observation to share at the end :) 

## Bibliography
Of course, as with all research work please include a good bibliography with links, and any references that were used or might give additional depth to the work. 

<a name="footnote-1">**[1]**</a>: Look at this little referenced footnote over here. You can look up different text formats for referencing books, online articles, films etc.
